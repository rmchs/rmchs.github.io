# RMCHS Microsites

Welcome to the source code of the Ramon Magsaysay (Cubao) High School microsites.
This website was created to bypass the limitations of Google Sites.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The author of this repository assumes you have already read the [HANDBOOK](https://github.com/rmchs/website-docs).

## Developing and Building
This is like any other SvelteKit app.
To start a development server, open the terminal with the current directory set here, the run:
```
npm run dev
```

To create a local build, run:
```
npm run build
```

This repository is configured so that changes will be built and will be deployed when you do a Git push.
