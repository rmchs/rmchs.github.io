    Some elements of the RMCHS website can not be made possible in Google Sites.
    It is limited and there are constraints, therefore this website was created.

<p>If you are a maintainer, you should've read the handbook for instructions on what to do with these sites.</p>
<p>If the handbook is somehow unavailable, you can access it via <a href="https://example.com">this link</a> and request access from the original maintainers themselves.</p>

    This website and its source code are currently being hosted at the 
    <a href="https://github.com/rmchs">RMCHS Github account.</a>
